I absolutely love this product, it exceeded my expectations.
The shipping took too long and the box was damaged.
Decent quality, but nothing special.
I’m very happy with my experience, would definitely buy again!
Terrible customer service, I felt ignored the whole time.
This is the best purchase I’ve made this year.
It’s okay, I’m not sure if I’d recommend it.
The app keeps crashing, super frustrating.
Great value for the price. Highly recommend.
I wouldn’t buy this again, very disappointing.
